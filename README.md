# Spelling English Words with Elemental Symbols

An algorithm to spell an input English word using chemical symbols so that leftover letters are minimized. The optimal solutions with that uses the fewest chemical symbols is chosen.  

For instance, "eras" would be spelled as `Er``As` rather than e`Ra`s because the first spelling has 0 letters not contained in the elemental symbols while the second has 2 leftover letters.  

Additionally, "rhinos" would be spelled as `Rh``In``Os` rather than `Rh``I``No``S` because, while both are optimal, the first spelling uses 3 symbols and the second uses 4.
